** AETHER ARENA **

**A Decentralized Esports Platform Demo **

**Created by:** Khushvinder Thakur (19, India)



**Inspiration:**

* **Reactive Network & ZetaChain:** Inspired by their cross-chain capabilities and innovative blockchain solutions.
* **Gemmi.ai:** Used as a tool to help conceptualize and refine the project idea.

**Core Features (Demo):**

* **Simplified Soulbound Token (SBT) Creation:** A basic UI for users to create and display their player SBTs, representing their in-game identity and achievements.
* **Basic Tournament Smart Contract:** A rudimentary smart contract demonstrating tournament creation and registration.
* **Automated Prize Distribution (Simulated):** A visual representation of how prize distribution could be automated through smart contracts.
* **XMTP Integration:** a basic implementation of XMTP for user to user messaging.
* **Data Visualization:** Basic data display from The Graph or Dune analytics, to demonstrate the usage of on-chain data.

**Key Technologies:**

* **Solidity:** For smart contract development.
* **React.js:** For frontend development.
* **Ethers.js/Web3.js:** For interacting with the blockchain.
* **Polygon (or similar):** For blockchain deployment (demo purposes).
* **XMTP:** for user to user messaging.
* **The Graph/Dune Analytics:** for data retrieval.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Focus:**

This demo focuses on demonstrating the core functionalities of:

1.  **Player Identity (SBTs):** Showcasing how players can establish their on-chain identity.
2.  **Tournament Management (Basic):** Illustrating the fundamental mechanics of tournament creation.
3.  **Automated Prize Distribution (Simulation):** Providing a visual representation of how prize distribution could be automated.
4.  **Web3 Messaging:** basic user to user messaging using XMTP.
5.  **Data display:** Basic data display from a data source.

**Limitations (Demo):**

* This is a demo and does not represent a fully functional esports platform.
* Smart contracts are simplified for demonstration purposes and may not be production-ready.
* Features are limited to those achievable within the hackathon timeframe.
* Gameplay is not implemented, the project is focused on the tournament and social aspects.

**Getting Started (Demo):**

1.  **Clone the Repository:** `git clone [https://github.com/thakursanju/Aether-battlefield]`
2.  **Install Dependencies:** `npm install` or `yarn install`
3.  **Run the Application:** `npm start` or `yarn start`
4.  **Interact with the Demo:** Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the demo features.

**Future Development (Beyond Hackathon):**

* Implement full gameplay integration.
* Enhance smart contract security and functionality.
* Develop a more robust and user-friendly UI.
* Integrate advanced data analytics and visualization.
* Expand XMTP features.
* Implement a full DAO.
