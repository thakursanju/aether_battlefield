## Overview
Aether Battlefield is a Web3-based competitive gaming hub designed to merge entertainment, transparency, and true digital ownership.  
It empowers players to compete, earn, and trade game assets securely through blockchain technology.  
Built on Ethereum and Polygon, it ensures decentralized reward systems, transparent tournaments, and full player control.

## Problem It Solves
- Players lack real ownership of in-game assets; items remain controlled by centralized servers.  
- Tournament rewards and transactions are often opaque and prone to manipulation.  
- Game progress and data can be lost when servers are shut down or accounts banned.  
- Developers face technical barriers when integrating blockchain or token economies.  
- Players maintain fragmented identities across multiple games, lacking a unified ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Play-to-Earn System:** Players are rewarded with $AETHER tokens for victories and achievements.  
- **NFT Asset Ownership:** In-game items and collectibles are minted as NFTs, allowing trade and proof of authenticity.  
- **Smart Contract Automation:** Rewards, transactions, and tournament logic are executed transparently on-chain.  
- **DAO Governance:** Game updates, event rules, and roadmap decisions are managed through community voting.  
- **Wallet-Based Identity:** A single crypto wallet acts as the player’s profile across all games in the ecosystem.

## Challenges Faced
- Integration issues between React frontend and blockchain contracts, resolved using Wagmi and Ethers.js.  
- Transition from centralized to decentralized NFT metadata storage via IPFS (Pinata).  
- High gas fees and transaction delays on Ethereum mitigated by migrating to Polygon Layer 2.  
- Complexity in DAO logic handled using OpenZeppelin’s modular governance contracts.
